# 🎯 FIX YOUR LOGIN - 30 Second Fix

## The Problem
You got 401 because you tried to login with an **email that doesn't exist in the database**.

## The Solution

### Copy & Paste These 3 Commands In Order

**Command 1 - Register:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/clients/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test-'$(date +%s)'@example.com","password":"TestPass123!","phone":"+1234567890"}'
```
→ Copy the `"email"` value from response

**Command 2 - Login (use email from Command 1):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/clients/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test-1730456123@example.com","password":"TestPass123!"}'
```
→ Replace `test-1730456123@example.com` with your email from Command 1
→ Copy the `"access_token"` value from response

**Command 3 - Get Profile (use token from Command 2):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/clients/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```
→ Replace the token with your token from Command 2

✅ **All 3 commands should work!**

## Why It Happened

❌ Wrong: Login with `john.doe@example.com` (doesn't exist)
✅ Right: Register first, then login with that same email

## Done!

The auth system is working perfectly. You just need to:
1. Register an email first
2. Then login with that exact same email
3. Then use the token to access profile

That's it! 🚀
